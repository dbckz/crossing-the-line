# Crossing the line: abuse of footballers on Twitter during the Men's 2020 European Football Championship

This repository contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data collection and analysis for my master's thesis on the abuse of footballers on Twitter during Euro 2020, submitted to King's College London in September 2021.

## Cautionary note
There is good amount of tech debt in this repository. The code is over-engineered in places, and may not be trivial to understand or use. I hope to find time to pay off some of this tech debt in late 2021/2022. If you would like to help out, please do submit a pull request!
