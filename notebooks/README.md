# Notebooks for data analysis
This directory contains various Jupyter notebooks used to analyse the tweet data.

They can be run on Google Colab (each notebook contains a direct link to open it in Colab). Colab is integrated with Google Drive, so tweet data that is stored in Google Drive can be easily loaded as dataframes by the notebooks.
